"""ocp_vscode's transport: the websocket client, pointed at a VS Code viewer.

The client itself is `ocp_viewer_core.websocket` - the protocol, the framing,
the port discovery and the listener are the same for any host that talks to a
viewer over a websocket, and a second one needing them is what said they were
never this package's.

What is left here is what is genuinely VS Code's: the sentence printed when
several viewers are open and the editor is about to raise an input box, and the
module-level `set_port` / `get_port` / `find_and_set_port` that scripts and
`docs/ports.md` have always had.
