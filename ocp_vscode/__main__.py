"""`python -m ocp_vscode --backend`: the measurement backend for a VS Code viewer.

`controller.ts` spawns this with the port of the viewer it has just opened.
The backend itself is `ocp_viewer_core.backend`, shared with every host; what
this module supplies is the transport, which is the only part that is ours.

Run with no arguments it points at `ocp_viewer`, which is the standalone
viewer - that used to be started from here.
